# Creating a MultiStep form with React Hook Form

Everyone agrees that filling out forms is really boring. But, it is almost impossible to leave them aside.

So how can we improve the experience for users?

One way is to split the inputs into several steps. So let's learn how to do this using one of the best ways, let's combine the use of `react-hook-form` to manage the state, `zod` for validation, `material ui` for the interface and of course, `typescript` to improve the experience as a dev.
